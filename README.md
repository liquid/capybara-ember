# Capybara::Ember

Makes Poltergeist/Selenium's `click` method aware of the Ember Run Loop.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'capybara-ember', require: false
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-ember

## Usage

Require `capybara/ember` in your test file, for example in `rails_helper.rb` or `spec_helper.rb` to set up Capybara's Poltergeist/Selenium driver and make it aware of the [Ember Run Loop](http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/run-loop/). This forces Poltergeist/Selenium to wait with `click` until the Ember Run Loop has finished, so that the clicks will be effective.

No modification to your existing tests are necessary.
